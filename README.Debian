Sphinxsearch
------------

searchd will start automatically however the default configuration does not supply
any indexes. Therefore, searchd will not continue running. You have to edit
/etc/sphinxsearch/sphinx.conf to get any meaningful mode of operation.

Documentation is available in /usr/share/doc/sphinxsearch.
